# Example-SQLite-Database-in-Android-Studios
Android Studios project that showed how to use a SQLite Database to store employee and inventory data in a mobile app.


This project used a SQLite database in an Android application to keep track of employees and inventory data.
  The project was ment to be heavily focused on the database portion, therefore I worked creating views and 
  running queries.
